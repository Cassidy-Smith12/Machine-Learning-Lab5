 Exercise 1:
 Given the following dataset: Student-Pass-Fail.csv, use logistic regression to find the odds,
 and predict whether a student will Pass or Fail given the following three data points: [7, 28], [10,34], [2, 39].
 Print the probabilities for each one of the three data points.

 Exercise 2:
 In continuation of Ex. 1, estimate the accuracy score of the model and print the Confusion
 Matrix. You will have to create your own functions to split the data (given by the user), estimate
 the modelâ€™s accuracy score, and compute the Confusion Matrix.

 Exercise 3:
 Given the following dataset: Bank-data.csv, use logistic regression to find the odds, 
 and predict whether a client will subscribe a term deposit or not given the following two data points:
 [1.335, 0, 1, 0, 0, 109], [1.25, 0, 0, 1, 0, 279]. Print the probabilities for each one of the two data
 points.
